# Programming Idioms

This is a dumping ground for programming idioms. You know, the kinda stuff
that becomes second nature when you are fluent in a language, but can be
foreign to the uninitiated. The goal is to create a single resource of idioms
for any all languages. This will be a learning tool for novices and a reference
for veterans.
